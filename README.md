# Dynamics 365 SDK Chatbot

## Overview

This project contains resources for developing a chatbot for Dynamics 365 SDK. It includes Python scripts, Dynamics 365 Commerce resources, and other configuration files required to set up the environment. The goal of this repository is to facilitate chatbot integration and customization within the Dynamics 365 ecosystem.

## Contents

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and folders that should be ignored by Git for version control.
- **Code-Generator.py**: A Python script intended for generating code automatically. This script helps speed up the development process by creating boilerplate code for Dynamics 365 chatbot integration. It uses several libraries to accomplish its tasks, including:
  - **os**: Used for interacting with the operating system, such as reading and writing files.
  - **re**: Regular expressions are used for searching and manipulating text within the code.
  - **argparse**: Facilitates the creation of a command-line interface, making the script easier to run with different parameters.
  - **jinja2**: A popular templating engine, used to generate code templates dynamically based on predefined formats.

  The script helps automate repetitive coding tasks by using templates, which can be especially useful when dealing with various Dynamics 365 SDK components.

- **Dynamics365Commerce.InStore-release-9.52.zip**: Contains resources or code related to the Dynamics 365 Commerce InStore module (version 9.52). This module likely provides in-store capabilities for the chatbot, such as integration with point-of-sale systems or inventory management.
- **Dynamics365Commerce.ScaleUnit-release-9.52.zip**: Contains resources or code related to the Dynamics 365 Commerce ScaleUnit module (version 9.52). This module helps in scaling and managing workloads, ensuring that the chatbot operates efficiently even under high demand by balancing the processing load.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- **requirments.txt.txt**: Lists the dependencies required to run the project. This file should be renamed to `requirements.txt` to follow standard naming conventions.

## Setup Instructions

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Install the required packages using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Note: Rename `requirments.txt.txt` to `requirements.txt` before running the above command.

   The `requirements.txt` file may contain common libraries such as:
   - **requests**: For making HTTP requests, potentially used for API calls to Dynamics 365.
   - **flask**: A micro web framework that could be used if there is a need to set up webhooks or integrate with other services.
   - **jinja2**: For rendering dynamic templates, which is often necessary when generating customized code.

3. **Extract Dynamics 365 Commerce Resources**:
   Extract the contents of `Dynamics365Commerce.InStore-release-9.52.zip` and `Dynamics365Commerce.ScaleUnit-release-9.52.zip` into appropriate directories.

4. **Run Code Generator**:
   Use the `Code-Generator.py` script to generate necessary code components:

   ```bash
   python Code-Generator.py
   ```

   This script will generate code based on pre-defined templates, which can be modified as per the requirements of the specific Dynamics 365 modules you are working on.

## Project Structure

- **Scripts**: Contains Python scripts to facilitate chatbot development.
- **Commerce Modules**: Zipped files related to Dynamics 365 Commerce functionalities.
- **Configuration**: `.gitignore` and `requirements` files for project setup.
